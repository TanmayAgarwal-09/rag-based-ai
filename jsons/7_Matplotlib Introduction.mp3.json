Well as you might have inferred by the name, it's a plotting library, more specifically a Python plotting library, so it'll fit in with what we've been using before. And what matplotlib does is it allows us to turn our data into some pretty visualizations, also known as plots or figures. So let's get started. If we refer back to our machine learning modeling framework, we go through problem definition, data, evaluation, features, modeling, experiments, then if we go back to where our tools fit in, we're going to be covering matplotlib, which is a part of the data analysis section, but can also, as you'll see with all of these tools, can also be part of the experiment section, we'll get to that in a future video, don't you worry? But this is going to complete the trifecta of pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. And why don't you start to see these three in action, it really makes sense the synergy these three provide in doing data analysis and exploring different data sets. So why matplotlib? Well, first of all, it's built on numpy arrays and Python. As we've discussed before, a lot of data and numerical information are built upon numpy arrays, including pandas, data frames, and it's the same with matplotlib. And because all of this is written in Python, we won't have to learn another coding language. So now we can work with our data and create visualizations, as you'll see shortly, with the same coding language. It integrates directly with pandas through the matplotlib pandas API. You can create basic or advanced plots, and again, like the other libraries, right? Matplotlib, if you can imagine a visualization, if you can imagine a plot, you can probably create it using matplotlib, but we're going to be focused on the most useful types of plots.

And then finally, you'll save or share the plot, because as you could imagine, looking at a big table of data full of numbers, they can get quite confusing. Humans, we're visual creatures, right? We want to see things visually. So that's where these plots come in handy. So you can save or share them to visually communicate your work, rather than just having it in a table full of numbers.
