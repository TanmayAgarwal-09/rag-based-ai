How beautiful of an animal is this panda? Now the thing about pandas is they've usually got black ears with white face and some of them have black around their eyes But in rare cases you get different patterns of black No, I'm kidding where we're not talking about the animal pandas, but that would be pretty cool We're talking about the data analysis library pandas now if you're doing machine learning or data science in Huythin you're going to be using pandas and it's used to explore data Analyze data manipulate data get it ready for machine learning. So that's what we're going to be focused on So if we revisit our framework We've got this data modeling section here. We've been through these steps Now we're going to really start to get into some of the tools that we can use So let's change this up a little We've still got our framework up here But now we're starting to dive into these tools. We've covered Jupyter notebooks We've looked at anaconda and mini-conda. We've set up an environment using those Now we're going to start diving in to doing data analysis first with things like pandas, map plot, lemma, numpy and then later on we'll look at some machine learning But for now we're focused on pandas, which is part of usually part of these three steps here the data analysis section Now why pandas? Well first of all it's simple to use It's integrated with many other data science and machine learning python tools because that's what we're focused on Right, we want to find machine learning and data science tools in python and use our knowledge of python to use those tools to gain insights out of data and build machine learning models and Often times you'll get your data in a format that isn't quite ready for machine learning The data is there, but fairly often you have to go through a few steps to make your data in a format that can be Imported into a machine learning algorithm and so that's where pandas comes in It helps us take a raw table of data raw data means data that you've just gathered and then manipulate it Ready so you can use it with machine learning algorithms So what are we going to cover in this section? Well, because pandas is so vast it would take quite a long time to look at the entire library So we're going to be focused on the most useful functions things that you'll use Basically in every data analysis that you do We'll look at the different types of pandas data types. There's two main ones series and data frame But we'll look at that in a second Look at how to import and export data using pandas Different ways you can describe your data So if you just imported some of your data How can you describe that statistically like what is the average value of a certain column etc Pandas is so beautiful in that it allows you to view and select your data in almost any way that you can imagine So if you can think of it you can probably do it in pandas and then finally once we've described Our data once we've seen it once we know how to select it We'll look at how we can change it up and manipulate it and we can massage it into a format that's ready for our machine learning algorithms So I think it's important before we actually start to jump into doing the actual code is to remember where you can get help As we go through these videos Follow along with the code in a Jupyter notebook if you can if you can't While the video is going don't worry just watch the video watch it as I go through it and then go through it on your own after the videos Done it's very important to try and just write the code yourself if in doubt Just run your code and don't worry if it an arrow pops up There's different places you can look such as stack overflow or pandas documentation to figure out what's gone wrong The most important is to try for yourself and then to try it again because this is what will help you learn So if in doubt run the code and then if you're still stuck don't forget It's always okay to ask a question.
