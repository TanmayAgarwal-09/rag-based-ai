I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Your First Day.mp3","number":"1","start":223.56,"end":227.48,"text":" Let's get to it. What is machine learning?"},{"title":"AIMachine LearningData Science.mp3","number":"3","start":118.96,"end":127.0,"text":" Now you may have also heard of deep learning and deep learning or deep neural networks is"},{"title":"AIMachine LearningData Science.mp3","number":"3","start":82.56,"end":86.36,"text":" Machine learning is a subset of AI."},{"title":"AIMachine LearningData Science.mp3","number":"3","start":8.88,"end":15.32,"text":" Like AI, artificial intelligence, data science, deep learning, neural networks."},{"title":"AIMachine LearningData Science.mp3","number":"3","start":0.0,"end":5.92,"text":" Okay, so we have an idea of what machine learning is."}]

"what is deep learning"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
