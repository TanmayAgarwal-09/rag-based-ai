I see you're really interested in learning about deep learning! So, you want to know more about it.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It's actually covered in the same video as machine learning, which is video 3.

If you want to learn more about deep learning, I'd recommend watching that video (AIMachine LearningData Science.mp3) from the start at timestamp 0:00 to around 1 minute and 30 seconds into the video. That's where we discuss what deep learning is and how it relates to machine learning and AI.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
